MRI personnel reminded Pt to stay still and the T2 was better than the T1 I think. There's also some interference from the gel in the hair from the EEG which made the images on the scanner console appear a bit fuzzy - not sure how much this will affect analysis. Pt is super duper tired and was likely asleep during some (many) of the scans. Pt denied falling asleep, but there were moments when it was difficult to get a response from her (via intercom) + Pt sounded sleepy + Pt struggled to stay awake during EEG - I'd be shocked if they were fully awake the entire scan. During resting and diffusion, the inline showed minimal movement, so the actual images are fine quality, but we might just be capturing their very sleepy brain's activity.		ok - check for EEG gell interference		2023-12-13; 12:12	Passes scan order	No missing series	No extra series	Passes volume comparison	Passes image orientation in anat	Passes image orientation in others	Passes shim settings	Passes bval comparison	Passes bit check	Passes dicom count	Passes enhanced check		Pass	Kota	Pass			3	ringing, slight motion causing blurriness, bright spots surrounding skull due to residual EEG gel but does not impede on brain matter	3	same as T1	4	no notable issues	4	no notable issues	3	motion throughout							4	no notable issues			3	motion (51-61)			4	no notable issues			4	no notable issues				sub-LA09541/ses-202307171

They had squeezed the squeeze ball right after the diffusion sequences and endorsed discomfort. After encouraging them to try to continue, the patient made it through the first resting state run of the block (3rd RS run overall) and most of the second run (4th and final overall). With a little less than 2 minutes remaining in the final run, they squeezed the squeeze ball again and asked to come out. Although we were nearly finished, given that this was the second time they squeezed the ball, we stopped the scan.

He moved his legs several time during [20] dMRI_b0_AP (marked good because I couldn't spot blurriness) and [21] dMRI_dir176_PA (marked poor).

Not in summary, but there are also fails in scan order (extra scout and localizer, and some scans out of order). However, the runsheet makes note of this –  "The participant wanted a break time” – and all scans are accounted for, so this should be OK. Further, protocol comparison “ReceiveCoilActiveElements” fails for many series.
